This is an implementation of temporal registration as described in http://people.csail.mit.edu/ruizhi/tmpReg. The implementation is based on ITK. It can be built from source using CMake (http://cmake.org) (BUILD_EXAMPLES needs to be ON).

The registration code with rigid transformation model is released. 

Usage:
${bin}TemporalRegistration_Rigid $output_dir $num_of_images $fixed_image_mask $weight_of_temporal_rotation_smoothness $weight_of_temporal_translation_smoothness $fixed_image $moving_image_1 [...]

Example:
${bin}TemporalRegistration_Rigid ../registration_results/ 5 ../imageDir/fixed_image_mask.nii.gz 1 0 ../image_dir/fixed_image.nii.gz ../image_dir/moving_image_1.nii.gz ../image_dir/moving_image_2.nii.gz ../image_dir/moving_image_3.nii.gz ../image_dir/moving_image_4.nii.gz

About ITK
-----

ITK is an open-source, cross-platform C++ toolkit for segmentation and
registration. Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying
data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled
representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as
CT or MRI scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
correspondences between data. For example, in the medical environment, a
CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information
contained in both.
